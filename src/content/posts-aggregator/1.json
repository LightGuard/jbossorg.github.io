  "content": " I've been invited to come back and give a talk at my university as part of their alumni spotlight series.    The funny thing is, this event has been in the planning since pre-pandemic days last year and was initially to be onsite and in person for everyone.    A year later and it's a different world where we still need to do these things virtually and online.    Next Thursday, 25 Feb 2021 from 16:00 - 17:00 I'll be sharing some motivational insights from my personal career journey since leaving the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.    It's a talk that centers how being open can mean everything to your career. If you are interested, reach out and I'll share the online connection information for this session and we'll be talking about more of the following. The following will be shared online in a virtual event with anyone wanting to attend.     OPEN IS KEY TO EVERY CAREER    It's not a coincidence. It's not just luck. It's not going to happen by itself, so what's the secret sauce for accelerating your career path? Understanding what makes a career grow, what choices are crucial, and what actions accelerate or damage your future are sometimes hard to grasp. Learning to position, expand and grow your personal brand in an open source world is what this session provides. Be ready for your next career step using open source principles. Join me for a story sharing a clear and easy to use plan for jump starting your career immediately.    Again, reach out if you want to join, I'll share connection information closer to the event. Slides will be posted online on the day of the event. "
