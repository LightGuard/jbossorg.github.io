  "content": "Part 1 - An architectural introduction  This article launches a new series exploring the cloud adoption architecture blueprint. It's focusing on presenting access to ways of mapping successful implementations for specific use cases.            It's an interesting challenge creating architectural content based on common customer adoption patterns. That's very different from most of the traditional marketing activities usually associated with generating content for the sole purpose of positioning products for solutions. When you're basing the content on actual execution in solution delivery, you're cutting out the chuff.   What's that mean?  It means that it's going to provide you with a way to implement a solution using open source technologies by focusing on the integrations, structures and interactions that actually have been proven to work. What's not included are any vendor promises that you'll find in normal marketing content. Those promised that when it gets down to implementation crunch time, might not fully deliver on their promises.  Enter the term Architectural Blueprint.   Let's look at these blueprints, how they're created and what value they provide for your solution designs.     THE PROCESS  The first step is to decide the use case to start with and in this case the focus was on how customers and organisations are able to adopt cloud usage across their existing data centers, private clouds, and while making use of public clouds. The key here is to manage their workloads across all of their diverse hybrid cloud architecture.  The case we're tackling here is focusing on Cloud Adoption. This use case we've defined as the following:    Accelerating cloud adoption with effective automation for deploying and managing workloads across multiple cloud infrastructures according to performance, security, compliance, and cost requirements.   The approach taken is to research our existing customers that have implemented solutions in this space, collect their public facing content, research the internal implementation documentation collections from their successful engagements, and where necessary reach out to the field resources involved.     To get an idea of what these blueprints look like, we refer you to the following published series:   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   Now on to the task at hand.     WHAT'S NEXT  The resulting content for this project targets the following three items.   * A slide deck of the architectural blueprint for use telling the portfolio    solution story.  * Generic architectural diagrams providing the general details for the    portfolio solution.  * A write-up of the portfolio solution in a series that can be used for a    customer solution brief.  An overview of this series on the cloud adoption portfolio architecture blueprint:   1.   2. Common architectural elements  3. Example adoption architecture  Catch up on any past articles you missed by following any published links above.  Next in this series, taking a look at the generic common architectural elements for the cloud adoption architecture.   (Article co-authored by , Chief Architect Retail, Red Hat) "
