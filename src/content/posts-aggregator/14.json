If this is your first time here, is a standalone tool that is also integrated into Business Central to be used by the Datasets editor and Content Manager page for creating dashboards and reporting. Don’t forget to go through the to familiarize yourself with the terminology, if you are a first-time user.  Dashboards are quintessential ways of representing complex data indicating key performance indicators(KPIs), metrics, and other key data points related to business or specific processes accurately and precisely.  When it comes to building dashboards, you can configure the dashboards to consume your own datasets in DashBuilder from a variety of sources like Bean, CSV, SQL, Prometheus, Elastic Search, Kafka, and Execution server. In this post, you will learn how to add and configure a Prometheus dataset for your dashboards.   ABOUT PROMETHEUS  Prometheus is a systems monitoring and alerting toolkit which can be used to collect and visualize time series data via a multi-dimensional data model identified by metric name and key/value pairs. It uses PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality. Head over to the for more details.   ADD AND CONFIGURE PROMETHEUS DATASETS ON DASHBUILDER   1. Log in to DashBuilder. You will see the homepage which resembles the     screen below.  DashBuilder Home page  2. In order to add a dataset, select Datasets from the menu. Alternatively, you     can also click on the “Menu” dropdown on the top left corner beside the     DashBuilder logo on the navigation bar. You will now see two headings,     “DashBuilder” and “Administration”. Click on “Datasets” under     Administration. You will see the Dataset Authoring home page with     instructions to add datasets, create displayers and new dashboards. Data Set     Authoring Home page     3. Now, you can either click on the “New Data Set” on the top left corner        beside “Data Set Explorer” or click on the “new data set” hyperlink in        Step 1. You will now see a Data Set creation wizard screen that shows all        dataset providers like Bean, CSV, SQL, Elastic Search, and so on. Data        Set Creation Wizard Page        4. Select “Prometheus” from the list of provider types. You will now see           the following screen to add your Prometheus data sets with a form that           asks you to add details about the Prometheus data set like Server URL,           Query etc. Prometheus Settings page           5. Start a Prometheus server. In the Configuration tab, the first              field is “UUID”, which stands for the data set’s unique identifier,              which is auto-generated. Enter a name for your data set against the              “Name” field, which will help you identify your data set while              adding components. For the “Server URL”, just add the Prometheus              server URL, the default URL is . Against the “Query” field, write              the PromQL query to retrieve data for this data set. If you are              confused about the role of the fields, please hover on the question              mark icons beside the fields or the text boxes adjacent to them.              Click on Test to preview your dataset.              6. You are now on the Preview tab. You can now have a look at the                 data columns and add filters in the tabs above the dataset. You                 can also edit the types or delete the columns that you don’t                 require by unchecking the checkbox beside the columns provided                 on the left side. If the preview isn’t what you expected, you                 can switch back to the Configuration tab by clicking on it and                 make changes. If you are satisfied with the preview, click on                 the “Next” button. Preview tab in Data Set creation wizard                 7. Enter required comments in the Save modal and click on the                    Save button. Your dataset has been added and configured. You                    will now be directed back to the Data Set Authoring Home                    page. You can now see a dataset on the left pane. When you                    add multiple datasets, you can see the list of all of them on                    the left pane. Here is a screen recording of the full flow.                    Here, I have added a sample dataset using the . Adding and                    configuring Prometheus datasets on DashBuilder You can now                    click on the Menu dropdown on the navigation bar and select                    Content Manager to create pages and dashboards. The “Time                    Series Chart” component in the “Reporting” section supports                    time series datasets. Ensure that the columns are well                    configured with proper types in the “Data” section of the                    “Displayer Editor” after dragging the component. The                    resulting dataset for time-series component can contain                    multiple series, but the columns should be TIME, followed by                    SERIES followed by VALUES for component property “transposed:                    true” and TIME, followed by Series VALUES for component                    property “transposed: false”, you can choose to configure the                    same while configuring Datasets or with the “Data” tab after                    dragging the time-series component to the page. Make sure                    that the columns are properly configured. Sometimes, some                    columns are missing when it comes to real-time data, but they                    will appear as soon as the metrics collection process starts.                    You can refer to the dashboard zip that I created . Refresh                    dropdown in Display tab If you are trying to get metrics and                    visualize real-time data, make sure to head over to the                    “Refresh” dropdown in the “Display” tab and set a value in                    seconds in the “Refresh” field that the component can use to                    constantly get real-time data.                                                            CONCLUSION                                        With the help of this post, you will be able to add and                    configure Prometheus datasets to be consumed by your                    dashboards. In the upcoming posts, we will add walkthroughs                    of the other dataset providers, so stay tuned!  The post appeared first on ."
