This post will give a quick overview of this release, and also add some highlights of our and releases. I hope you enjoy it!   BPMN AND DMN STANDALONE EDITORS  Since 0.7.2.alpha3 we started a new component of the KIE tooling, our standalone BPMN and DMN Editors. On the 0.8.1 release, we delivered the first official version of this cool library. 🎉  These Standalone Editors provide a straightforward way to use our tried-and-true DMN and BPMN Editors embedded in your web applications.  The editors are now distributed in a self-contained library that provides an all-in-one JavaScript file for each of them that can be interacted with using a comprehensive API for setup and control it.  Now it’s super easy to embed our editors in your applications, see this gist example:  View the code on .  That will render:   EMBED YOUR BPMN AND DMN MODELS  In the 0.8.2 release, we have introduced a new feature that will enable you easily embed your BPMN and DMN models on any web application with an iframe. We have updated our toolbar on the Business Modeler Preview, and now under the “Share” menu, there is an “Embed” option.  See the full for an in-depth look into this feature.   DMN EDITOR NOW OPENS 1.1 AND 1.3 ASSETS  The DMN editor continues evolving towards making users’ lives as simple as possible.
